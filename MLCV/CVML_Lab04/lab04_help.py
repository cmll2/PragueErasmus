    Loads the MNIST data saved in .npy or .npz files.

    If the 'labels' argument is left as None then the class assumes that the file
    in 'data' is .npz and creates attributes, with the same name as specified
    during the file creation, containing the respective numpy arrays.

    If the 'labels' argument is set to a string path then the class assumes that
    the files were saved as .npy and it will create two attributes: 'imgs' which
    contains the contents of the 'data' file and 'labels' with the contents of
    the 'labels' file.

    If you chose to save the arrays differently then you might have to modify
    this class or write your own loader.
